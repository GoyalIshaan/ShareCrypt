# ShareCrypt

![ShareCrypt Logo](path_to_your_logo_if_available)

ShareCrypt is a modern web application designed to enhance the security and privacy of information sharing over the internet. By allowing users to encrypt their data directly into a URL's search query, ShareCrypt ensures that sensitive information can be shared securely and privately with just a single link. This method eliminates the need for complex encryption tools and simplifies the process of secure communication.

## Project Overview

ShareCrypt leverages a unique approach to data sharing where users input their information, which is then encrypted and encoded into a search query. This generates a unique, secure link that can be shared with anyone. The recipient can use this link to decrypt and view the information without needing any special software, ensuring that the data remains confidential and secure throughout the transmission process.

### Key Features

- **Secure Encryption**: Utilizes robust encryption standards to secure data.
- **Easy Sharing**: Generates a link that can be easily shared with anyone.
- **No Additional Software Required**: Decrypts information directly through the link without the need for external tools.

## Challenges Faced

- **API Integration**: Integrating the encryption and decryption processes seamlessly into the frontend posed initial challenges, particularly with asynchronous data handling.
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring the application runs smoothly, particularly the map interactions and data encoding/decoding processes.
- **Responsive Design**: Implementing a fully responsive design using Tailwind CSS while maintaining the functionality across all devices.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (preferably the latest LTS version).

### Installation
